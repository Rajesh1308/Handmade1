        <p>I'm so Happy that you turned 18<br>
        Waiting to see you coming up with lots of dreams.<br>
        For ever and ever you have a special place<br>
        in my heart...<br>
        I feel so pride and joy when you are with me,<br>
        Always longing for the time and laughter with you.<br>
        For many long years, I was a person with lonely heart,<br>
        I forget this when we were talking for sometimes.<br>
        You are such a fabulous sister to me!<br>
        And I can't express it with words.<br>
        A sissy like you is my greatest gift.<br>
